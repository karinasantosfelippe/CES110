What is one program you wrote that you were particularly proud of during this course? Why were you proud? Explain.
The last program I wrote was the best to me. Not because it was more difficult or because of it has more complexity, but because I feel that I did all that I was able to do unitl the end of the course. I am dealing with too much things in my life, and yet God helped me to achieve 100% of my requirements and finish this course with so much knowledge and proud of myself.



How might you use the skills you learned in this course in the future? This might include skills such as programming, problem-solving, debugging, etc.
I am already using the skills that I learned in my personal projects to create Lambdas in AWS platform. It was amazing to learn a programming language that helped me with a such sample structure. I am glad that the Lord is helping me to achieve my goals at the right moment in my life.



Describe an experience from this class that has given you confidence that you can learn new programming skills in the future. 
Working with my teammates every week makes me realize how much I can do for myself alone, studying and searching new things, and use those things to help people around me. This course, in addition with Brother Copp messages encouraging me to keep going, has given me confidence to understand that I can share all things to God (including my programming skills goals), and ask Him to help. I already work with software development but this block I learned deeper about how can I share those things with my Heavenly Father. And I know that He will trust in me to share this knowledge and help people, to His purpose.
